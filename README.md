# Drone Path Planning with Real-Time Obstacle Detection

## Project Overview
This project simulates a drone navigating through a 3D environment with obstacles using advanced pathfinding algorithms and real-time obstacle detection. The drone autonomously plans optimal flight paths from a starting point to a destination while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles that appear during flight.

## Features
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Efficient path planning in 3D space
- **Real-Time Obstacle Detection**: Simulated sensor system with configurable range
- **Dynamic Path Replanning**: Ability to recalculate routes when new obstacles are detected
- **3D Visualization**: Complete visualization of the drone, obstacles, planned path, and sensor range
- **Simulation Environment**: No physical hardware required

## Technical Implementation
- **Pathfinding**: A* algorithm with customizable heuristics and movement patterns
- **Obstacle Detection**: Proximity-based detection within configurable sensor range
- **Path Following**: Smooth movement along calculated waypoints
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Simulation of obstacles that appear during flight

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) FFmpeg for animation export

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with ROS or AirSim for more realistic physics
- Implementation of additional pathfinding algorithms (RRT, D*)
- Machine learning-based obstacle prediction
- Swarm behavior with multiple drones

## Usage
Run the main simulation script to visualize the drone navigating through the environment:
```
python drone_simulation.py
```
